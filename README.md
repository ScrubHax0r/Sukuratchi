# Sukuratchi
A Discord bot that I'm working on


# Needs
    discord.py
    nekos.py

# How to install these dependencies:
    For discord.py:
        Linux/Mac
            python3 -m pip install -U discord.py
        Windows
            py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py

    For nekos.py:
        pip install nekos.py

# How to use
    In the same folder as bot.py, create a file called ".env" (Yeah, without a file name, should just be a file extension).
    In that file write TOKEN=(paste your bot token here)
    Create a file called prefixes.json (this will be used to store prefixes from different servers)
